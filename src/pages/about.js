          I am a young student interested in technology, games and codes. I have
          always sought to improve my knowledge and seek the most current,
          regardless of whether it is known or not, I have always tried to be in
          the midst of something new and different.

          My greatest desire is to be part of things, to be involved, to be able
          to leave my name in history is my goal, to be known!
